### Usage

Quickly assess the quality of sign videos using hotkeys.
It will create a CSV file with your annotations that you can copy and paste into the shared csv file.

hotkeys.json file can be modified to change hotkeys and to add/remove categories.

Annotations can be made while the video is playing or after it has finished.

DO NOT assign the  \`  key as it is used to end the process.

The `=` key moves to the next video

The `-` key replays the current video

Further instructions are provided after launching the script.

### Inputs
directory: _path to directory containing the sign group directories_

group: _relative subdirectory path from directory as base to the specific videos that will be reviewed_

sign: _specific subdirectory in group containing recordings of one specific sign_

### Example
On Linux or macOS:
`./run.sh /path/to/directory/of/all/signs specific_group hello`
example_file.csv is an example output generated by running `python fast_annotate.py --directory /Users/anonymous/Downloads/4a.8006 --output example_file.csv --users cut cute`
