### Usage
Quickly assess the quality of sign videos using hotkeys.
Will create a CSV file with your annotations that you can copy and paste into the shared csv file.

hotkeys.json file can be modified to change hotkeys and to add/remove categories

Annotations can be made while the video is playing or after it has finished

DO NOT assign the  \`  key as it is used to end the process.

The `=` key moves to the next video

The `-` key replays the current video

### Inputs
-d/--directory _path to directory containing the sign directories_

-o/--output _output csv file that will have the annotations_ (defaults to annotations.csv)

-s/--signs _space delimeted list containing the signs to annotate_ 


### Example
`python fast_annotate.py --directory /Users/tylerkwok/Downloads/4a.8006 --output somefile.csv --signs dryer garbage flag`

example_file.csv is an example out the output generated by running `python fast_annotate.py --directory /Users/tylerkwok/Downloads/4a.8006 --output example_file.csv --signs cut cute`


### Current Problems

User cannot start from where they left off if they did not complete the last sign.
